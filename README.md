# Stock Prediction System using LSTM and Machine Learning

## Overview
This project implements a **Stock Prediction System** using **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks** and other Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to predict stock prices based on historical data, leveraging deep learning models for accurate and efficient forecasting.

## Features
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Uses past stock price data for trend analysis.
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Implements recurrent neural networks to capture long-term dependencies.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Integrates traditional ML models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, etc.) for comparison.
- **Data Visualization**: Provides graphical representations of stock trends and predictions.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Supports real-time data fetching and forecasting.
- **Scalability**: Can be extended to multiple stock indices and assets.

## System Architecture
The system consists of:
- **Data Collection Module**: Fetches stock market data from APIs like Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or Quandl.
- **Preprocessing Module**: Cleans and normalizes the dataset for model training.
- **LSTM-Based Model**: A deep learning model trained for time-series forecasting.
- **Evaluation Module**: Compares the performance of different models.
- **Web Dashboard / Mobile App**: Allows users to view stock predictions and trends.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data processing and model training.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework for LSTM implementation.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Machine learning library for traditional models.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Data visualization libraries.
- **Flask / Django**: Web framework for dashboard implementation.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Data manipulation and numerical operations.

## Installation & Setup
### 1. Environment Setup
- Install Python (>=3.8)
- Install required libraries using:
  ```bash
  pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn flask
  ```

### 2. Data Collection
- Fetch stock data using an API.
- Store the data in CSV or a database.

### 3. Model Training
- Preprocess the dataset.
- Train the LSTM model with historical stock data.
- Evaluate the model using different performance metrics.

### 4. Deployment
- Integrate the model into a Flask/Django web application.
- Deploy the system on a cloud server or local machine.

## Usage
- Access the web dashboard to input stock ticker symbols.
- View past trends and future stock price predictions.
- Compare predictions with actual market prices.

## Future Enhancements
- Integration with reinforcement learning for better decision-making.
- Real-time news sentiment analysis to improve predictions.
- Mobile app version for stock monitoring on-the-go.
